# LoveMire Component Library
Collection of importable components for Project: LoveMire UI. Built as a process to remove the usage of MUI and allow for internal theming.

There'd be nothing wrong with using MUI or another UI in this component library so long as the configuration and themeing is kept in this library.

Nimble app.
